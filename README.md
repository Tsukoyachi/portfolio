# portfolio
My personnal portfolio, not really sure if it's gonna be interesting, I test thing for the moment.
- To improve my skills I won't use bootstrap for the moment.
- Since I host my portfolio with github page, it doesn't allow POST request so for the moment the contact form don't work for you, it will when I'll host the website somewhere else at the end of my testing.
